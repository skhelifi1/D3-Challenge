# D3-Challenge

* D3 was used to read into a csv file, extract the data needed and plot a scatter plot for income vs Smoking to visualize trends across the nation by state. 

* D3 was used to generate the scatter plot inside an SVG.

* Each data point on the scatter plot represents income and % smokers for that income for a specific state.
